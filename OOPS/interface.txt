- Interface is basically a pure abstract class which contains only abstract methods.
- Python does not have a pre-defined 'interface' keyword. Python also isn't that strict
as compared to Java in terms of interface, as in Java interfaces strictly cannot have
concrete methods.
- Abstract classes can have implemented methods, interfaces(in the form of abstract classes)
typically do not.
- We use abstract classes when we want to provide some shared functionality and enforce 
method implementation. We use interfaces when we want to define a strict contract w/out 
implementation.
- We can create interface in python by using abstract classes.
- Syntax for that will be:
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
class class_name(ABC):
  #@abstractmethod
  def method_name():
    #some code
